# Keylogger ðŸ†˜

The practice of keystroke logging involves tracking and recording each keystroke entry made on a computer, often without the user's permission or knowledge.
Basically, a "keystroke" is any action you perform on your keyboard.

The goal is build a keylogger that sends emails containing recorded data from the target machine.
